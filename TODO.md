# TODO: Convert AddMenu Modal to Standalone Page

## Steps to Complete:
1. Add a new route in approuter.jsx for /menu-management/add that renders the AddMenu component.
2. Modify MenuManagement.jsx to navigate to the new page instead of opening a modal, and remove modal-related code.
3. Update AddMenu.jsx to handle navigation (back button and save functionality) using React Router.
4. Test the changes to ensure the Add Menu functionality opens as a full page.
